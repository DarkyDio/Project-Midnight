# Project-Midnight
Project: Midnight is a Y2K-era horror game inspired by the FNAF saga. Built in GitHub Codespaces, it blends FNAF 1 &amp; 2 mechanics. Play as Alister Thorne, a former "Employee of the Month" blacklisted since 1985. Survive from 12AM to 3AM using CRT tech before the Y2K glitch seals your fate. A tribute to retro-tech and survival strategy.
