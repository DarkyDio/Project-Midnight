## 📜 Synopsis
In 1985, **Alister Thorne** was the pride of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza—a three-time **"Employee of the Month."** Following the tragic incidents, she became a social pariah, blacklisted from every job due to her past ties with the franchise. 

Now, on the eve of the new millennium (December 31st, 1999), Alister has accepted a desperate position at a high-security storage facility. Her task: oversee the **Project: Midnight** protocols during the Y2K transition. She knows the machines... but now the machines recognize her.
